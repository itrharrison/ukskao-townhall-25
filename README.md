## Registration
To register for either in-person or online attendance, please follow the link [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/annual-uk-skao-science-committee-town-hall-17th-18th-november-2025-tickets-1541380072289?aff=oddtdtcreator).

## Location
The Town Hall will be located in the WX3.07 room of the School of Physics and Astronomy at Cardiff University

You can find the School on google maps [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/M9uK2BpVGZbLjqp19).

The WX (West Extension) building itself is [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Hs3gNAJCHgnJKisx7) and you can find further information about Accessibility within the building [here](https://www.accessable.co.uk/cardiff-university/cathays-park-campus/access-guides/west-building-extension).

The building is just outside the city centre (less than five minutes from the edge), so is readily accessible by public transport and walking. If you require parking a limited amount is available, with details at the bottom of [this page](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/visit/accessibility/cathays-park-campus/queens-buildings).

On the Monday morning there will be both signs and people guiding you as to how to get to the room.
